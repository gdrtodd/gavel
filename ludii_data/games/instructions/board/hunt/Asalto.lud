Played on the Fox and Geese board, but the top arm of the cross is surrounded by a double line, indicating it is a fortress, in which one player puts two officers. The opponent has 24 pieces, which occupy the points outside the fortress. Officers may capture one of the opponent's pieces by hopping over it to an empty space immediately on the opposite side of the opponent's piece. If the officer does not capture when it is possible, it is huffed. The soldiers win by occupying all of the points in the fortress or by blocking the officers from being able to move; the officers win by capturing enough soldiers to prevent this.
