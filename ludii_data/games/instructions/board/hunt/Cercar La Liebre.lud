One player is the rabbit, and the other player plays with twelve other pieces. They may also play with either ten or eleven pieces instead of twelve. The pieces move along the lines. The goal is to corner the rabbit so that it cannot move. The rabbit may hop over the other pieces to capture them. The rabbit wins by reducing the opponent to nine pieces. Played on a Alquerque Board. The hare can jump to capture.
