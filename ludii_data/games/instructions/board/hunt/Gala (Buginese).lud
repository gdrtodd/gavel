7x7 board, with an X in each corner space, the middle space along each side, and the central space. Black plays with thirteen pieces, white plays with ten. Black places the first piece on the central square, then players alternate turns placing a piece on their own half of the board. When all of the pieces are placed, players alternate turns moving pieces one space orthogonally. A piece is captured when it is surrounded on two opposite sides by opponent's pieces, or if it is in the corner and there are two opponent's pieces blocking it from moving. Capturing cannot happen in the placement phase. Black wins if it can block white from being able to move. White wins if it is impossible for black to block them.
