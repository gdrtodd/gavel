Three diamonds in a row, the central one connecting to the others one opposite corners. A horizontal line connects the top corners of the diamonds, another horizontal line connects the bottom corners of the diamonds, and a longer horizontal line connects all the middle corners. The outer two diamonds have vertical lines connecting their top and bottom corners. One player plays as three hounds, which begin on the outer corner and top and bottom corner of one of the end diamonds. The other player plays as one hare, which begins on the central point of the same diamond. Players alternate turns moving a piece to an empty adjacent spot along the lines of the board. The Hare moves first. The hounds win by blocking the hare from being able to move. The game has an ending condition only for P2.
