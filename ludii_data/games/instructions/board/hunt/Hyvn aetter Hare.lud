Square board, divided into eight equal triangles, and a circle around the square, touching it at the corners, One player plays as the hare, the other player as three hounds. Players take turns placing one of their pieces on the board. When a player has placed all their pieces, they move to an adjacent empty spot. When the hounds block the hare from being able to move, the hounds win. The First player moves only when all the pieces are placed.
