8x8 Draughts board. One player plays with a single fox, the other with twelve hens, played on the white squares. The hens begin on the first three rows; the fox may begin on whatever spot the player chooses. Hens move one space forward diagonally, the fox moves one space diagonally forward or backward. The fox may capture a hen by hopping over it to an empty space diagonally on the other side of it. The hens win by blocking the fox from being able to move; the fox wins by capturing all the hens.
