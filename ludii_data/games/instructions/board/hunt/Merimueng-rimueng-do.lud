One player plays as the tigers (five in number), the other as the sheep (fifteen in number). They take turns placing the pieces on the intersections of the lines. When all of the player's pieces are on the board, the piece may move to any adjacent intersection along the connecting lines. The tiger hops over a sheep to capture it. The goal of the tiger is to capture all of the sheep; the sheep try to prevent all of the tigers from moving.
