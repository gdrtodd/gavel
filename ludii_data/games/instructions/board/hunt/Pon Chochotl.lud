To be reconstructed. Rules as inferred by Murray 1951. One player is the bean, and the other player plays with twelve corn kernels. The corn kernels move along the lines. The goal is to corner the bean so that it cannot move. The bean may hop over the corn kernels to capture them or move to an adjacent empty point along the lines. The bean wins by reducing the opponent to nine corn kernels. The coyote can jump to capture.
