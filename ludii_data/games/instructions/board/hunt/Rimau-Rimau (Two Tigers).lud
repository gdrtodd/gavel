5x5 intersecting lines, with diagonals in each quadrant. Two triangles, the apexes of which intersect with the square at the midpoint of opposite sides. One line bisecting the base of the triangle, and another bisecting this line. One player plays as two tigers, the other as 23 people. One of the tigers begins on any spot on the board. Eight of the people begin on the spots surrounding the central point of the board. The tiger player, on their first turn, removes one of the people and then places the second tiger anywhere on the board. The people then play, placing one of the remaining people on an empty spot on the board. On the tiger's turn, the player may move one of the tigers to an empty adjacent spot along the lines of the board. The tiger may also capture a person by hopping over it to an empty adjacent spot immediately on the opposite side of it along the lines of the board. When all of the people are placed, they move to an empty adjacent spot along the lines of the board on their turn. The tigers win by capturing all the people; the people win by blocking both tigers from being able to move. The two tigers start in the hand.
