Play begins with an empty board. Black goes first. Players alternate turns. The game proceeds in two phases: Drop phase: Players place one cone per turn on any vacant cell on the special 9×5 centre area of the board. Players may not move a cone until all their cones have been placed. After the drop phase is completed, the conspirateurs scatter to hide in sanctuaries. A sanctuary may hold at most one man. The first to bring all his conspirateurs to sanctuary wins the game. Move phase: If a conspirateur starts the turn already on a sanctuary then it can’t move. Players move one man per turn to a vacant point one step in any direction orthogonally or diagonally, or players may leap over an adjacent man (friend or foe; and whether the jumpee is on a sanctuary or not) and land on the vacant point immediately beyond. Multiple leaps are allowed in a single turn: a man may continue to leap in any direction as long as there are jumps to be made, and may stop jumping at any point (leaps are not compulsory). A jumped man is not captured (there is no capturing in Conspirateurs). GAME END The game ends when a player brings all her conspirateurs to shelter holes (sanctuaries), thus winning the game
