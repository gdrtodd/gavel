Played on a 4x4 grid. Each player has seven pieces, placed on the intersections of the lines, five on the back row and one on each outer intersection of the second line. Pieces are moved diagonally across the squares. The object is to place one's pieces in the opponent's starting position. The first player to do so wins.
