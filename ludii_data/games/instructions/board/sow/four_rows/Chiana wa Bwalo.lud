4 row board, of any number of holes. Four counters in each player's outer row. Sowing occurs from the player's rearmost hole and in an anti-clockwise direction. When the final counter lands in an empty hole in the inner row, any counters in the opposite hole in the opponent's inner row are captured. The player who captures all of the opponent's counters wins. Each player has 16 holes per row.
