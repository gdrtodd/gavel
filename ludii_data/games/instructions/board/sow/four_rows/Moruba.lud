4x12 board. Four counters in each hole. Players alternate turns sowing the counters from one hole in an anti-clockwise direction. When the counters fall into a hole in their inner row, the contents of the opponent's opposite inner row hole are captured, as are any in the opponent's corresponding outer row hole, but only if counters were captured from the inner row hole. The player who captures the most counters wins.
