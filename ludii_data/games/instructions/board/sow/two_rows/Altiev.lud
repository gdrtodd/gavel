2x6 board. Three counters in each hole. Sowing occurs from one of the holes in the player's row. If the final counter lands in an occupied hole, these counters are picked up and sowing continues. If the final counter lands in an empty hole in the player's own row, any counters in the opposite row hole are captured. A player wins when the opponent's row is empty.
