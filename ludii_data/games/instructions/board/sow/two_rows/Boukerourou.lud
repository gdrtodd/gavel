2x4 board, rendered as holes in the sand. Six counters per hole. A player picks up all of the counters in one of the holes in their row and sows them in an anti-clockwise direction. When the final counter lands in an empty hole, the contents of the following hole are picked up and the sowing continues. When the final counter lands in a hole in the opponent's row causing it to contain six counters, these counters are captured. Play continues until one player has no counters in their holes, and the opponent wins.
