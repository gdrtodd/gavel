2x7 board with two stores. Seven counters in each hole. Players move from one of the holes in their row, sowing in a clockwise direction, and including the player's store, which is to the left, but not the opponent's store. If the final counter of a sowing lands in an occupied hole (not a store), sowing continues. If it lands into an empty hole, the turn is over. If the empty hole is in the player's own row, the contents of the hole opposite in the opponent's row are captured and placed in the store. The person who captures the most counters wins.
