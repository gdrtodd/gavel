2x6 board with store holes at either end. The game begins with six counters in each hole. Each player owns one row of holes. At the beginning of the turn, a player picks up all of the counters from their side of the board and sows them, one each, into consecutive holes in a counterclockwise pattern. If the last counter lands in a hole that contains 2, 4, or 6 (after sowing), then the player captures the counters in that hole. If the player captures counters in a hole, then they may also capture counters in the previous hole, if it also has 2,4, or 6, continuing until reaching a hole without 2, 4, or 6. Play continues until one player cannot play on their turn, at which point the other player receives all of the remaining counters. The player with the most captured counters wins.
