2x6 board. Eight counters in each hole; two holes in one player's row and one in the opponent's row are left empty. Sowing in an anti-clockwise direction. No captures in first two turns. If the last counter falls into a hole that is occupied, these are picked up and the sowing continues. When the last counter of a sowing falls into an empty hole, the counters in the opposite hole are captured. The player continues play by moving the counter that made the capture into the next hole, and continuing play. If the last counter falls into an empty hole and the opposite hole is also empty, the turn ends. The player who captures the most counters wins.
