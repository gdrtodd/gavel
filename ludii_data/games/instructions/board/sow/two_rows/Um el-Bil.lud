2x6 board. Four counters in each hole. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. The first player sows from the hole on their right. When the final counter lands in an occupied hole, the turn ends. When the final counter lands in an empty hole, that counter is captured. The player who captures the most counters wins. The game is played with 6 holes per row.
