2x6 board. Six counters in each hole. Sowing occurs from any of the holes in the player's row, and continues in a clockwise direction. If the final counter lands in a hole in the player's row containing three counters, four with the addition of the final counter, these are captured. Play continues until one player cannot move or the board position repeats. When one player cannot move, the other player captures the remaining counters. The player with the most counters wins. The game ends if no moves or a repeating state is detected.
