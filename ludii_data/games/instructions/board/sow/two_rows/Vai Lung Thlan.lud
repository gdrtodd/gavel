2x6 board. Five counters in each hole. Sowing occurs from any hole in the player's row in a clockwise direction. If the final counter lands into an empty hole, it is captured. If there is an unbroken line of holes behind it also having single counters, these are also captured. The player who captures the most counters wins.
