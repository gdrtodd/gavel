2x6 board. Four counters in each hole. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction, beginning from any hole in the player's row. When the final counter lands in a hole in the opponent's row containing three (four counting the last counter dropped into it), these are taken. In addition, the contents of any hole in the opponent's row which a player causes to contain four counters are captured. When the final counter lands in an empty hole, the turn ends. When the final counter lands in an occupied hole containing a number of counters other than three, the counters are picked up and sowing continues. If sowing reaches the original hole from which the sowing began, this hole is skipped over. A player must play so that the opponent has counters with which to play, if possible.
