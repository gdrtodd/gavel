The board is a square with diagonals drawn, with the bottom side of the square marked with an X. Two pieces per player, which begin on opposite corners of the square, one player on the side with the X and the other to the opposite side. Players alternate turns moving one of their pieces along the lines of the board to an empty adjacent point. Players cannot move along the line marked with an X. When one player cannot move, the opponent wins.
