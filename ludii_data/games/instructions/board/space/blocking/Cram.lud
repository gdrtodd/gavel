The game is played on a sheet of graph paper, with any set of designs traced out. It is most commonly played on rectangular board like a 6Ã—6 square. Two players have a collection of dominoes which they place on the grid in turn. A player can place a domino either horizontally or vertically. Contrary to the related game of Domineering, the possible moves are the same for the two players, and Cram is then an impartial game. As for all impartial games, there are two possible conventions for victory: in the normal game, the first player who cannot move loses, and on the contrary, in the misere version, the first player who cannot move wins. The board has 6 rows. The board has 6 columns. The Last player to play wins.
