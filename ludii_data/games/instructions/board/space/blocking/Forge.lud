MOVEMENT - A stone must move as far as it can (no jumps) in a forward direction (orthogonal or diagonal). - At the first move, a player may choose any of his stones to move. - After that, a player must move a stone that is adjacent to the last moved enemy stone. If that is not possible, the player may choose any unblocked of his stones to move. - There is no capturing. GOAL - Wins the player that moved the last stone.
