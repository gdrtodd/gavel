OBJECT OF THE GAME The last player to make a move wins. FRIENDLY AND ENEMY CONNECTIONS A connection, i.e. an orthogonal adjacency between two checkers, is friendly if the two checkers are the same color and enemy if the two checkers are oppositely colored. CHECKER VALUE A checker’s value is its number of friendly connections minus its number of enemy connections. MOVES A checker’s value must increase when it‘s moved. Move a checker to an unoccupied, orthogonally adjacent square. There is no capturing in Jostle, only jostling. The game is played on a 10x10 square board.
