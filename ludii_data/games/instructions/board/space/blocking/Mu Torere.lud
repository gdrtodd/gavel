Play begins with the pieces on the kewai, each player on half of the circle. Players move by moving one piece to an empty adjacent space. Players can only move to the putahi when the piece being moved is next to an opponent's piece. The player that blocks the other from moving is the winner. The game is played on a wheel board. The game is played with all the rules
