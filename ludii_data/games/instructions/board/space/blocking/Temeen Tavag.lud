An X, with a rounded line connecting the four endpoints of the X, but leaving two unconnected. A circle is drawn between these two unconnected endpoints. Two pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing one of their pieces on an empty point on the board. When all of the pieces are placed, players alternate turns moving one of the pieces to an empty adjacent point on the board, moving along the lines. The player who blocks their opponent from being able to move wins. The board is a circle.
