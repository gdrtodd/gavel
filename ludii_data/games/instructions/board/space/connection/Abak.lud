The aim of Abak is to be the first player to connect one of the orange squares in the centre of the board to any one orange squares in the corners by forming a continuous row of counters of one colour. In the first phase, each player places one counter on one of the orange squares in the centre of the board. They continue to take turns to place their counters on a free adjacent square (squares are adjacent if they touch on the sides or diagonally by the points). The counter may be placed beside counters of any colour. Once placed, a counter may not be moved. During the game, if a counter is surrounded by more than 4 occupied squares, that counter is removed. Moreover, if then a counter becomes isolated, it is also removed from the board. The game is played on a 11x11 board. Two players.
