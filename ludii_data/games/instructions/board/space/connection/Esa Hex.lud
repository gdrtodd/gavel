The rules are similar to Hex. Players take turns placing their pieces on one space on the board, with the goal of connecting the opposite sides of the board corresponding to the color of their pieces with a line of pieces. However, in the first turn, P1 places a piece of their colour as first move. Then, players alternate placing two pieces of their colour per turn. No swap rule is needed. The game is played on a 11x11 board. The game does not use the swap rule. The first player to connect their two sides wins.
