This game is played on a square grid board of any size, though 13x13 or 19x19 are recommended. Then the players take it in turns to place 1-3 black stones each turn until one decides to pass; that player then becomes Black, and the other becomes White. After that, players take it in turns to place one stone of their colour on the board on any empty point. If Black connects any two sides of the board with a single orthogonally-connected group, they win; White wins if they connect all four sides with a group connected either orthogonally or diagonally. During the initial chicken ballot phase, you may add stones by clicking on available spaces, or skip the rest of your placements (by choosing the Next Player action). Alternatively, you may Pass at the start of your turn to take Black. After that, you and your opponent will alternate playing one stone of your colour per turn, until one player forms a connection (draws are impossible in Pippinzip). Played on a size 13 board.
