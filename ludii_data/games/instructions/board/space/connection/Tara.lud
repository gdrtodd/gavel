MOVE - Each player inserts a stone onto the board from an edge. Black inserts from top and pushes from top to bottom, White inserts from left and pushes from left to right. - Black starts with a stone on the top-left corner. - Passing is not allowed - If a stone, when pushed meets another stone, this too is pushed on the same direction, and so on... EDGE - A stone pushed off the edge during a push is returned to the player (there are no captures). If it is an opponent stone, this row/column cannot be used on the next turn (friendly stones do not have such restriction). GOAL - Wins the player which makes a path between the edges (top-bottom for Black, right-left for White). Stones may be connected orthogonal or diagonal.
