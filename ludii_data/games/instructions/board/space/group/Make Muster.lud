On your turn, place a single piece of your color on an empty position that is not next to another friendly piece. This is compulsory whenever it is possible to do so. When it is not possible to place a piece; then instead, step one of your pieces to an adjacent empty position. You win either: -- when all your pieces become connected, or -- when you cut-off your opponent from being able to connect theirs. Board: Muster order 3 board - 45 positions Angled cells
