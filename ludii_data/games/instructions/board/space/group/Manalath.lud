Players take turns placing pieces of any colour. They can't create groups of more than five pieces which are adjacent to each other. A group of 4 pieces is called a quart. A group of 5 pieces is called a quint. Players win if they finish their turn with a friendly quint, but lose if they finish their turn with a friendly quart on the board. Note: The winning and losing conditions for a player are checked after their move, only on their own turn. An end condition (win or loss) is effective when it occurred first and cannot be averted.
