GROUP - A connected chain of friendly stones. TURN - Initially, Black drops one stone of either color, then for the remaining turns players drop two stones of either color. GOAL - After the board is full, wins the player with the higher product between its two largest groups. If both products are equal, wins the player with less stones on board (note: draws are impossible).
