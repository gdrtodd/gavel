5x6 board. Each player has twelve pieces. Players alternate placing their pieces until they are all placed on the board. Players cannot make a row of three pieces in the placement phase. Once the pieces are all on the board, they may be moved one space orthogonally. The goal is to make a line of three, which allows the player to capture one of the opponent's pieces. In the case that a move creates two lines of three, only one capture is made. The player who captures the most pieces wins. Matches are typically played to a score of ten, with a player scoring one point by winning a game, and two points for winning without any of their pieces being captured.
