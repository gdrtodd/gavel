3x3 intersecting lines with diagonals. Play occurs on the intersections of the lines. Each player has three pieces. Play begins with each player placing pieces on empty points. If they make three in a row along the lines, they win. Once all pieces are placed, players take turns moving pieces one spot to an adjacent point along the lines trying to make three in a row.
