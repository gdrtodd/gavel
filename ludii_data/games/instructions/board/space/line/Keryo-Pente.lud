Keryo-Pente is played on a 19x19 Go board. White goes first, and plays their first move on the centre point (unless playing Freestyle). After the opening, players alternate playing one stone of their colour onto any empty point. If their placement results in a pair or a line of three enemy stones being sandwiched between two of their own stones, those enemy stones are captured. The first player to form an orthogonal or diagonal line of five (or more) of their stones, or to capture 15 enemy stones, wins the game. Played on a 19x19 board. Open at the centre point.
