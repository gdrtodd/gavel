According to the given rules, the pieces, eight on each army, start in reserve off the board. A move consists of either: 1) placing a piece from your reserve on any vacant square; 2) moving a piece to any adjacent square, orthogonally or diagonally (as a chess king), or 3) capturing an enemy piece by jumping it, like an 8-directional checker. Multiple jumps are allowed. When a jump is possible, jumping is compulsory, though the player may choose any jumping move available and need not capture the greatest possible number of pieces. The object is either to form a line of three of your pieces, orthogonally or diagonally with no intervening spaces, or to capture six enemy pieces (i.e. reduce your enemyâ€™s forces to two so that he cannot win).
