Three concentric squares, with lines connecting the corners and the midpoints of the sides. Twelve pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing a piece on the board. When a player makes a line of three of their pieces, they may remove one of the opponent's pieces. When all of the pieces have been placed, players alternate turns moving a piece to an empty adjacent spot along the lines of the board. A piece in the four outside corner spaces is allowed to move to any empty spot on the board. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.
