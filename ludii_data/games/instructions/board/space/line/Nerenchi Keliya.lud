Three concentric squares with lines connecting the midpoints of the squares. Nine pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing one of their pieces on an empty space. If a player places three of their pieces along one of the straight lines, they take another turn. Once all of the pieces are on the board, players take turns moving a piece to an empty space on the board. When a player creates a line of three in this phase, the player removes one of the opponent's pieces, and receives another turn. The player who reduces the opponent to two pieces wins.
