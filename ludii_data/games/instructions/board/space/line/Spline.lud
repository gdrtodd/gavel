Starting with white, each player places a marble on an empty space or platform (2x2 arrangement of marbles). The first player making a full line of his color on any layer wins. Lines may be diagonal. This is, for a 4x4 set, a 4-in-a-row on the first layer, or a 3-in-a-row on the 2nd layer, or a 2-in-a-row on the 3rd layer. The game is played with two players. The game is played on a 4x4 board.
