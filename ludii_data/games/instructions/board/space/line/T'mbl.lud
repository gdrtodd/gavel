3x3 intersecting lines, with diagonals drawn in the square. Three pieces per player, which begin on the three points on opposite sides of the board. Players alternate turns moving a piece to an empty adjacent spot along the lines of the board. The first player to place three of their pieces in a row along one of the lines which is not one of the sides of the square, wins.
