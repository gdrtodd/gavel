3x3 intersecting lines. Three pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing a piece on the board. When all of the pieces have been placed, the players alternate turns moving a piece to an empty adjacent spot. A piece which is surrounded on opposite sides by pieces belonging to the opponent cannot be moved. The player who places three of their stones in a row along one of the lines wins.
