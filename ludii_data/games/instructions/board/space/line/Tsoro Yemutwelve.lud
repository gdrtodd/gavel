Three concentric squares, with lines connecting the diagonals and the midpoints of the sides. Twelve pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing one of their pieces on one of the empty intersections of the board. If a player places three of their stones in a straight line, the player may remove one of the opponent's pieces. When all of the pieces have been placed, the players alternate turns moving one of their pieces to an empty adjacent point along the lines of the board. When a player is reduced to three pieces, they may move one of their stone to any empty space on the board. The player who reduces their opponent to two pieces wins.
