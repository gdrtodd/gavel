6x6 board. Twelve pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing a piece on an empty space on the board. No captures may be made in the placement phase. When all of the pieces have been placed, players alternate turns moving a piece orthogonally to an empty adjacent space on the board. When a player places three of their pieces in an orthogonal row, they remove one of the opponent's pieces. Lines of four or more do not capture. Moving a piece out of a line of four or more, making it now a line of three, does not capture. Lines of three made during the placement phase also do not result in capture. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.
