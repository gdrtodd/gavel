Each player begins with two pieces on the four corners of the board, with each player's pieces in opposite corners. Players move one piece one or two spaces in any direction orthogonally or diagonally. If the piece is moved on space, another piece is added on the origin space. All of the opponent's pieces adjacent to the space to which the player moved now belong to the player who moved. Play ends when all spaces have been filled or one of the players has no remaining pieces. The player with the most pieces wins.
