Played on a 19x19 board. The board begins empty. One player plays as black, the other as white. The black player begins by placing a piece on one of the intersections on the board. Players alternate turns placing a piece on the board. A player may pass at any time. A piece or a group of pieces are captured when they are completely surrounded on all sides on adjacent intersections by the opposing player. Stones cannot be placed to recreate a previous position. The game ends when both players pass consecutively. Players total the number of intersections their pieces occupy or surround. The player with the highest total wins. The game is played on a 19x19 board
