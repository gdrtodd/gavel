The board begins empty. One player plays as black, the other as white. The black player begins by placing a piece on one of the intersections on the board. Players alternate turns placing a piece on the board. A player may pass at any time. A piece or a group of pieces are captured when they are completely surrounded on all sides on adjacent intersections by the opposing player. Stones cannot be placed to recreate a previous position. The game ends when both players pass consecutively. Players total the number of intersections their pieces occupy or surround. The player with the highest total wins.
