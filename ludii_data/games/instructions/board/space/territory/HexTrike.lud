Play on a hexagonal grid composed of hexagons. Use a neutral pawn and black/white checkers. Players take turns moving a neutral pawn around on the board (passing is not allowed). The neutral pawn can move any number of empty points, in any direction in a straight line, but cannot move onto, or jump over occupied points. When a player moves the pawn, first they place a checker of their own color, onto the destination point. Then they move the pawn on top of it. When the pawn is trapped, the game is over. At the end of the game, each player gets a point for each checker of their own color adjacent to the pawn; if the number of adjacent checkers is equal, the checker under the trapped pawn breaks the tie. The person with the highest score wins. Played on a Hexagonal Board. Played on a size 7 board.
