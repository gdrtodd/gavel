Play on an equilateral hexagonal triangle-tessellated grid. The board is seeded randomly with a black stone, a white stone, and a neutral stone. Players take turn seeding new groups. Every placement triggers growth of all enemy groups, where growth is defined as adding a stone to all empty cells adjacent to a group. When the board fills up, the person who has more pieces on the board wins. Played on a size 7 board.
