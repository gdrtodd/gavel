One-Eyed Go follows the same rules as go (e.g. Japanese Rules) with the exception that it is never allowed to place a stone such that your own group has no liberties, even when they would capture other stones. This renders the ko rule superfluous. The game is played on a 19x19 board
(game "One-Eyed Go" (players 2) (equipment {(board (square 19) use:Vertex) (piece "Marker" Each)}) (rules (play (or (do (move Add (to (sites Empty))) ifAfterwards:(gt (count Liberties Orthogonal) 0) (then (enclose (from (last To)) Orthogonal (between if:(is Enemy (who at:(between))) (apply (and (addScore Mover 1) (remove (between)))))))) (move Pass))) (end (if (all Passed) (byScore {(score P1 (add (score P1) (size Territory P1))) (score P2 (add (score P2) (size Territory P2)))})))))
