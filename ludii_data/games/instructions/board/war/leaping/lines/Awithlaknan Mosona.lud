A series of three parallel lines are drawn, with diagonals connecting the outer lines at intervals, crossing each other at the central line. Eight in the outer rows, nine in the central. Pieces are moved along the intersections, and they are placed on the board on opposing sides, leaving the central spot empty. The first player moves to this spot along one of the lines, and the opponent jumps this pieces, thereby capturing it.
