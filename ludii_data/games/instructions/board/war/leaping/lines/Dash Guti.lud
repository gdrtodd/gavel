Each player lays out the pieces on the board on the intersections of the lines, each filling all the intersections of the triangle closest to the player, plus the extra intersection to their right. Play moves to the next adjacent intersection connected by a line. Opponent's pieces can be captured by hopping over them. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.
