Played on an Alquerque board with triangular appendages at the top and bottom. Sixteen pieces per player. Each player moves one spot along the lines on the board. Captures are made by hopping over an opponent's piece. Multiple hops are allowed per turn if possible. Captures are not compulsory. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.
