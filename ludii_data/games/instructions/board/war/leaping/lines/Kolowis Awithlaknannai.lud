A series of three parallel lines are drawn, with diagonals connecting the outer lines at intervals, crossing each other at the central line. Sixteen spaces each row. Pieces begin on all of the points on the board, except the central point and the leftmost point of the central row. Pieces are moved along the intersections, and they are placed on the board on opposing sides, leaving the central spot empty. The first player moves to this spot along one of the lines, and the opponent jumps this pieces, thereby capturing it.
