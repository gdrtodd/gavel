4x4 board, eight pieces each player. Pieces move orthogonally by either jumping a player's own piece to capture an opponent's piece or by moving one space into an empty hole. Captures are not compulsory. The goal is to reduce the opponents pieces to 1 or blocking them so they can no longer move. The game is played on a 4x4 board. The game starts with half the board owned by each player.
