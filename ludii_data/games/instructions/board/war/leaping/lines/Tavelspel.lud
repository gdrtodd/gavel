13x13 intersecting lines. Two players. Each player has 26 pieces. Pieces begin on the two lines closest to each player, opposite sides of the board. Pieces move along the lines of the board to an adjacent spot. A piece can be captured by hopping over an opponent's adjacent piece to an empty spot immediately on the opposite side of it. Multiple captures are allowed. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.
