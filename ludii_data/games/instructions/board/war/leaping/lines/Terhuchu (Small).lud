5x5 intersecting lines, with diagonals drawn in each quadrant. Ten pieces per player, which begin on the two rows closes to the player. Players alternate turns moving a piece to an empty adjacent spot along the lines. A piece may capture an opponent's piece by hopping over it along the lines of the board to an empty spot immediately on the opposite side of the opponent's piece. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins. Each player has 10 pieces.
