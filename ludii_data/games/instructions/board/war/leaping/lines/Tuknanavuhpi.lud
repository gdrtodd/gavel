Played on a grid of 4x4 squares, each square with both diagonals. Pieces are played on the intersections of the lines, moving to an empty point along one of the lines. Play begins with 20 pieces per player. Players take turns moving the pieces, and capture the opponent's pieces by hopping over them. When the back line on a player's side of the board is vacated, it is no longer in play. The player who captures the other player's pieces wins.
