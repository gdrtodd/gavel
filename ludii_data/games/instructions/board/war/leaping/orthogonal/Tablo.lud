7x7 lines, forming a grid. 21 pieces per player. The pieces begin on the three rows closest to the player. Pieces move forward orthogonally or sideways, never backwards. A piece may capture an adjacent opponent's piece by hopping over it to an empty adjacent spot immediately on the opposite side of it along the lines of the board. Multiple captures are allowed. Captures can only be made in the forward orthogonal or sideways directions also. The player who captures all of their opponent's pieces or who blocks them from being able to move wins.
