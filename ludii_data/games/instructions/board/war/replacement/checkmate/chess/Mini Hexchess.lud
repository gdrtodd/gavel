Mini Hexchess is played on a hexagonal board with each side having length 5, and each space oriented horizontally. The board has 37 spaces. Piece Movement: * Kings, Rooks, Bishops, and Knights move as in Glinski Chess. - Kings step one space in any of the 12 directions. They do not castle. - Rooks slide in any of the 6 adjacent directions. - Bishops slide in any of the 6 'diagonal' directions. - Knights move two spaces in any adjacent direction, then one space in another direction. * There are no Queens in Mini Hexchess. * Pawns can advance one space forward without capturing. Pawns can never advance more than one space. Pawns capture 'diagonally forward' (i.e., to a space ahead connected by an edge, and having the same colour). There is no en passant capture. On reaching the farthest rank in a given file, Pawns are promoted to a Rook, Bishop, or Knight. Note that a Pawn cannot be promoted to a Queen, since there are no Queens in Mini Hexchess. The game ends on a checkmate or stalemate.
