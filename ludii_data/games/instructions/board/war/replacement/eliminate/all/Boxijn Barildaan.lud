Four squares, arranged in a cross shape. The game is played along the lines. Four pieces per player, which begin on the corners of a square, opposite the square where the opponent's pieces are arranged. Players alternate turns moving their pieces. Pieces move three spaces along the lines on the board, capturing any piece on the third. The first two spaces in the move must be empty. Pieces may change direction in a turn, as long as the lines are followed and there is no backtracking. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.
