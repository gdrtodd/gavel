There are three red ships and three black ships. The remainder of the cells contain white icebergs. The two players, Red and Black, take turns moving one of their own ships, one move per turn, starting with Red. Players are not allowed to pass. MOVES: You must move one of your ships to an adjacent cell which doesn't contain another ship. By moving to a cell containing an iceberg, you capture the iceberg, and your score increases by 1. MOVE DIRECTION: You must select one of your ships to move, and move it closer to its closest iceberg. Distance is measured by the number of cells between ship and iceberg along the shortest path of cells that connects them, going around other ships. If the ship you've chosen to move has icebergs adjacent to it, you must capture one of them. OBJECT OF THE GAME: The goal is to capture the majority of the icebergs. On the default size 5 board, there are 55 icebergs starting out. If you capture 28 of them, you win. A size 5 board is currently selected
