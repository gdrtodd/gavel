Play starts with black. On his turn a player may either drop a stone of his color or remove a dead enemy group. Players may only legally drop stones adjacent to at least one of their stones already on the board. For boards sized 11x11 and smaller a group is considered dead if any stone within it meets the following criteria. a)The stone has no empty points orthogonally adjacent b)The stone has at least one enemy stone adjacent For boards larger than 11x11 only the first criterion applies when determining if a group is dead. You may never remove your own dead groups. If a player has no legal move on his turn he must pass. Passing is otherwise not permitted. The player to remove all opposing groups from the board wins. A size 13 board is currently selected
