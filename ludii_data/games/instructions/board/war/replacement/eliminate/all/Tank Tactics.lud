Each player controls a tank with three health and an initial shooting range of two spaces. Each player gains one action point at the start of their turn. Players may use an action point during their turn to perform one of four actions: - Move their tank to an adjacent space. - Shoot at another tank within shooting range, deducting one point of health. - Trade with another tank within shooting range, increasing the owning players action points by one. - Increase the shooting range of their tank by one space. Players can pass to conserve action points between turns. A player loses if their tank reaches zero health. 2 players. The game is played on a 5x10 board.
