Setup: Pieces of each color are distributed symmetrically on every 3rd cell of the board. (For a game on an order 4 board, the outer cells are not used.) Four game options are provided: 1. Keep-a-riding - Goal: Last to move. Play: No passing. Pieces step to join larger group. When they can't step to join larger group, they can slide to capture. 2. Conflagration, - Goal: Win when you you have no fire left or can't make a move. Play: No passing. A piece can either take a single step to join a larger group, or slide to capture an opponent's piece. 3. Conflagration, - Firestorm Variant (longer) Rule restriction: A piece can only slide to capture when it cannot step to join a larger group. 4. Conflagration, - Backfire Variant (shorter), Rule restriction: A piece can only step to join a larger group when it cannot slide to capture. Conflagration Standard version Order 4 board
