The graph is initially coloured. The goal of the general version of the puzzle is to uncolour edges until the coloured graph is a regular graph. The goal of the parameter-k version of the puzzle is to uncolour edges until the coloured graph is a k-regular graph. The game is played on the Graph1. General version
