Initially, the graph contains only uncoloured vertices. At each turn, a player chooses a vertex to colour with his own colour, or pass. If there is no other adjacent vertex with the same colour, the player receives the weight of the vertex as score. When all vertices are coloured, or all players pass, the player who with the maximum score wins.  The version of the game played with 2 players.
