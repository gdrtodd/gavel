Wagner is a non-capturing game. Initially, each player places a stone at any vertex (not the centre) to maintain the graph colouring rules (i.e., no two friendly pieces are adjacent to each other). Each turn a player moves a friendly stone to an adjacent empty site. The goal is to make all the friendly pieces into a single group.
