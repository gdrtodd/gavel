Each player simultaneously bets on what the sum of all fingers shown will be. Each bet is added to a common pot. Then each player simultaneously reveals their hand, extending any number of fingers. Any player who successfully guesses the total number of fingers revealed by all players combined scores a point. The game is over when a player reaches a score of 3. The winning players share the pot. The game is played with 2 players.
