The goal is to place three mines in every row, column and region. The digits in the grid represent the number of mines in the neighbouring cells. 
(game "Sudoku Mine" (players 1) (equipment {(board (square 9) (values Cell (range 0 1))) (hints {(hint 5 1) (hint 7 2) (hint 8 1) (hint 10 3) (hint 19 1) (hint 24 3) (hint 29 3) (hint 35 4) (hint 39 3) (hint 41 3) (hint 45 4) (hint 51 2) (hint 56 3) (hint 61 2) (hint 70 3) (hint 72 1) (hint 73 1) (hint 75 1)}) (regions {Columns Rows}) (piece "Bomb" P1)}) (rules (play (satisfy {(forAll Hint (is Count (sites Around (from)) of:1 (hint))) (forAll Hint (equals (what at:(from)) 0)) (is Sum 3)})) (end (if (is Solved) (result P1 Win)))))
