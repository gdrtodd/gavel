The board is a five-pointed star. The player has nine pieces. In the first phase, the player attempts to place all the pieces on the board. The player choses a point, then moves the piece two spaces in a straight line. The piece may move through a spot occupied by another piece, but must land on an empty space. Once all of the pieces are placed in this way, the player captures a piece on the board by hopping over with with another one of the pieces to an empty space on the opposite side of the piece to be captured. The goal is to capture all of the pieces except one.
