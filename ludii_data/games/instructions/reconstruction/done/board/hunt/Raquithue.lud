The game Raquithue is played by two players on a noshape board with nobasis tiling. Player one plays with Lions. Player two plays with Dogs. Rules for Pieces: Dogs hop orthogonal. Lions hop orthogonal or step orthogonal or if 1 is equal to State at the location of the piece, slide from the location of the piece in the orthogonal direction through empty then set the state of the Vertex the to location of the last move to 0. Players take turns moving. Setup: Place a Lion for player one at the vertexes with coordinates [D8]. Place a Dog for player two at the bottom sites of the board expanded by 1 steps.. Rules: Move one of your pieces. Aim: If the number of pieces owned by Player the next player is less than or equal to 3, the next player loses. The Raquithue (Ludii 1) ruleset.
