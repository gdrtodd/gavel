The game Dimraw is played by two players on a noshape board with nobasis tiling. All players play with Markers. Rules for Pieces: Markers step adjacent then if a player places 3 of their pieces in an orthogonal direction line, move again. Players take turns moving. Rules: If in the same turn, remove pieces at sites occupied by any component owned by Next in Board, else from vertex in Player the moving player's hand site 0 to vertex in the set of empty vertexs moveRule: true then if a player places 3 of their pieces in an adjacent direction line, the to location of the last move is in sites [1,4,6] and all sites in sites [1,4,6] satisfy the condition Player at current site is equal to the moving player, the to location of the last move is in sites [1,4,7] and all sites in sites [1,4,7] satisfy the condition Player at current site is equal to the moving player, the to location of the last move is in sites [7,10,11] and all sites in sites [7,10,11] satisfy the condition Player at current site is equal to the moving player, the to location of the last move is in sites [13,10,11] and all sites in sites [13,10,11] satisfy the condition Player at current site is equal to the moving player, the to location of the last move is in sites [18,15,13] and all sites in sites [18,15,13] satisfy the condition Player at current site is equal to the moving player, the to location of the last move is in sites [12,15,18] and all sites in sites [12,15,18] satisfy the condition Player at current site is equal to the moving player, the to location of the last move is in sites [8,9,12] and all sites in sites [8,9,12] satisfy the condition Player at current site is equal to the moving player or the to location of the last move is in sites [8,9,6] and all sites in sites [8,9,6] satisfy the condition Player at current site is equal to the moving player, move again if in the same turn, remove pieces at sites occupied by any component owned by Next in Board, else move one of your pieces. Aim: If the number of pieces owned by Player the next player is less than or equal to 2, the moving player wins. The Dimraw (Ludii 1) ruleset.
