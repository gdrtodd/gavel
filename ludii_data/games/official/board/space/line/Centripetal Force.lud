        (description "Centripetal Force is a paper-and-pencil game for two players inspired by Connect4, but using four different directions from which you can drop the tokens.
        It was invented by Gabriele Soranzo during a school lesson to play with his classmate simply with paper and pen without being seen by the professor.")
        (rules "At the beginning of the game, the board is empty except for the central cell which is occupied by a square which belongs to neither player.
            
            The first player plays with crosses, the second with circles.
            Each player, on his turn, must place his marker on the grid onto an empty cell respecting the following rule:
            the marker is dropped from one of the four sides of the board choosing a row or a column, and, proceeding in a straight line so that it goes inside of the board, it stops in front of the first obstacle (a marker of any of the two players, or the central square).
            Pretty much the same as what happens in Connect4, except here there are four dropping directions.
            If the marker reaches the opposite side without encountering any obstacles, the move is illegal.
            
            To win the game you need to be the first to form an horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of at least five of your markers.
        If there are no available moves, the game ends in a draw.")
