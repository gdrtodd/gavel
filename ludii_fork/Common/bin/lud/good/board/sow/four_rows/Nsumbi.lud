Players capture when the sowing ends in a player's inner row and the opponent's inner and outer row holes opposite contain counters; these are captured and sown in the player's rows starting from the same hole that the previous sowing began. If the final counter lands in an occupied hole but capture is not possible, the counters in this hole are picked up and sowing continues. If the final counter ends in an empty hole, the turn ends. Captures cannot be made on each player's first turn. Play continues until one player has no holes with two or more counters, and the opponent wins.")
