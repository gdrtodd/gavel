When the last counter falls into a hole, sowing continues if there are counters in the following holes; these are picked up and sowing continues from there. When the hole after the end of a sowing is empty, the counters in the next hole following it are captured. If a pattern of alternating empty and occupied holes continues after this, the counters in the occupied holes are captured, until there are two occupied or two empty holes in a row. The player who captures the most counters wins.")
