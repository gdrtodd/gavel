        (description "French Wari is a two-row mancala-style board game from Barbados. It was documented in the early twentieth century, but likely was played on the island by enslaved African people who brought the game from West Africa. It is similar to other mancala games found throughout the Caribbean and West Africa.")
        (rules "2x6 board. Play begins with four counters in each hole. Moves begin from any hole in the player's row and sowing proceeds in an anti-clockwise direction. If the final counter of a sowing lands in an occupied hole, these counters are lifted and sowing continues. If the final counter lands in an empty hole, any counters in the opposite hole are taken and the turn ends. Play continues until one player cannot move. When this happens, the other player captures the remaining counters and the game ends. The player with the most counters wins.")
