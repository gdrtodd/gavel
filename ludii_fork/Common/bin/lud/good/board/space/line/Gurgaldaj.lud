When all of the pieces are placed, players alternate turns moving a piece to an empty adjacent spot along the lines. When a player places three of their pieces in a row, they remove one of the opponent's pieces from the board. A piece that is in a three-in-a-row pattern cannot be removed. The player who removes all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
