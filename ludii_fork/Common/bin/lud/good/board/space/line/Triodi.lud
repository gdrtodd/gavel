        (rules "Three concentric squares, the midpoints of the squares connected with lines. Nine pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing a piece on an empty spot on the board. When all of the pieces are placed, the players alternate turns moving a piece to an empty adjacent spot along the lines. During either phase, when a player places three of their pieces in a row along the lines, the player removes any one of the opponent's pieces. The player who reduces the opponent to two pieces wins.")
