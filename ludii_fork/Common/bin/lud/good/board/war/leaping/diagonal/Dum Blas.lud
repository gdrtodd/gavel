Pieces move diagonally one space forward. Pieces may capture an opponent's piece by hopping over it diagonally to an empty adjacent square immediately on the other side of it. Pieces cannot capture in a backwards direction. The maximum number of pieces must be captured. If a player does not capture the maximum number of pieces, the other player may huff this piece, removing it from play. When a piece reaches the opposite edge of the board from where it started, it is promoted to king. Kings may move any distance diagonally, in a forward or backward direction. The player who captures all of their opponent's pieces wins.")
