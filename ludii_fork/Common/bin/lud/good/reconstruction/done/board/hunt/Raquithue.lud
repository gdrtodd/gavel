                Lions remove pieces at to then step adjacent or if not 1 is equal to State at the location of the piece, hop orthogonal or leap a piece to not is a friend or if the location of the piece is in the vertexes with coordinates [E8, D1], if empty, Piece at  the Vertex 1 steps ahead of the location of the piece in the direction west is equal to Rook of the moving player and not 1 is equal to State at  the Vertex 1 steps ahead of the location of the piece in the direction west, from vertex in the location of the piece to vertex  the Vertex 2 steps ahead of the location of the piece in the direction west moveRule: true or if empty, Piece at  the Vertex 1 steps ahead of the location of the piece in the direction east is equal to Rook of the moving player and not 1 is equal to State at  the Vertex 1 steps ahead of the location of the piece in the direction east, from vertex in the location of the piece to vertex  the Vertex 2 steps ahead of the location of the piece in the direction east moveRule: true set the state of the Vertex the to location of the last move to 1.
                Players take turns moving.
                Setup:
                Place a Lion for player one at the vertexes with coordinates [D8].
                Place a Dog for player two at the bottom sites of the board expanded by 1 steps..
                Rules: 
                Move one of your pieces.
                Aim: 
                If the number of pieces owned by Player the next player is less than or equal to 3, the next player loses.
