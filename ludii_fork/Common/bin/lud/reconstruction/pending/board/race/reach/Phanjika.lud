Seven cowries, used as dice. The value of a throw is equal to the number of cowries that land face-down; all cowries face-up equals 14 and there is a special rule attached to it. A throw of five (\"phanjika\") allows the player to enter a piece on the board. A piece that lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece is removed from the board and must reenter. Safe squaeres exist on the board. The first player to remove all of their pieces from the board wins.")
