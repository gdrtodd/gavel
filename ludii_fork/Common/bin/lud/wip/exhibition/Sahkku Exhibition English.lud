Pieces capture by hopping over an opponent's piece. They can capture multiple pieces in a sequence, must capture if possible, and must capture the maximum number of pieces in a turn. A piece is promoted when it reaches the opposite side of the board, then it can move forward or backward over any distance. The player who captures all of their opponent's pieces wins.​")
