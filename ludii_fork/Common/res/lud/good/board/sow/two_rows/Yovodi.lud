When the final counter of a sowing lands in an occupied hole, these are picked up and sowing continues. When the final counter lands in an empty hole in the player's own row, the contents of the hole opposite it in the opponent's row are captured. If the final counter lands in an empty hole in the opponent's row, the opponent captures the counters in the hole opposite it in the player's row. The player who captures the most counters wins.")
