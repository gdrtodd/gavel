        (rules "Your goal in Gobblet Junior is to place three of your pieces in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row. Your pieces can stack on top of each other, and they start the game nested, off the board. On a turn, you either play one exposed piece from your three off-the-board piles or move one piece on the board to any other spot on the board where it fits. A larger piece can cover any smaller piece.
            
        Your memory is tested as you try to remember which color one of your larger pieces is covering before you move it. As soon as a player has three like-colored pieces in a row, he wins.")
