        (rules "Played on a board similar to Perali Kotuma, with the addition of triangular extensions on the four corners. Play begins with nine pieces for each player. Pieces move along the lines to the next open space. Opponent's pieces can be captured by hopping over them. Within the triangular extensions, pieces may move two places at a time, in a straight line. The player to capture all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
