A piece can move forwards, straight ahead or diagonally, or sideways to an orthogonally adjacent field if that field is empty, and capture opponents' pieces by jumping left, right, or forwards. When they reach the opposite side, they become a king, which may move in all directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), as long as the path is clear of pieces, and can jump opponents' pieces from any distance orthogonally. Captures must be taken if possible, and the maximum number of jumps must be made. Multiple captures cannot be made by moving 180 degrees from the previous jump. Pieces can be promoted to king mid-jump. Winning is achieved by capturing all of the other player's pieces or by blocking them so they cannot move."))

Pieces may capture only in an orthogonal direction, but not backwards, by hopping over an adjacent piece belonging  to the opponent to an empty space on the opposite adjacent side of the opponent's piece. Multiple captures are allowed, and the maximum number of possible  captures must be  taken. When a piece lands on the last row  opposite from the one where they began the game, it is promoted and may move in any direction and capture in any orthogonal direction. A piece may be promoted in the middle of its turn if further captures are possible. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins. "))
