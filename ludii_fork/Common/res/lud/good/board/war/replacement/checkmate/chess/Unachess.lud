        (rules "Same as standard Chess except:
            1. The board is initially empty and each player has the normal complement of 16 pieces in reserve.
            2. During a turn, a player must do one of three things:
            --- place a piece from in hand on an empty square on the board
            --- move a previously placed piece to an empty square
            --- move a previously placed piece onto a square occupied by an opposing piece, capturing it.
            3. Pawns may be entered on the first, second, third or fourth rows only.
            4. No en-passant, castling, or initial double-step pawn moves.
        5. A player's King must be placed before being allowed to make any capturing moves. A piece that controls the square that the enemy King occupies does not check it until the friendly King is entered onto the board. That is called 'quasi-check'. A player is under no compulsion to move out of quasi-check, and may even move into quasi-check. A player may legally move into quasi-check.")
