It takes the form of a coiled snake that is segmented into spaces, and the board varies in the number of spaces that appear on it. It is only of the earliest multi-player games documented, with up to six players. Mehen was also played outside of Egypt, particularly in Cyprus and certain parts of the Levant, and was played in Cyprus for at least 1000 years after it became unpopular in Egypt.")

                of the spiral. The central space must be reached with an exact throw. To leave the central space,
                the player must throw two ones. The player then races in the opposite direction to leave the 
                board.
