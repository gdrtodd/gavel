The first player to place a pawn or a knight on the opponentâ€™s backrank wins (thus no promotions). The normal chess rules for piece movements have also been slightly modified to fit our simplified boardgame framework: castling, en-passant, and two-step pawn moves are not allowed; a king can be moved into and left in check (and thus captured); and the draw-by-threefold-repetition and 50-move rules do not apply.")
