The triangle's apex is the midpoint of the opposite side as the square. On the long sides, two identical squares which intersect with the third and seventh horizontal line of the main part of the board, on the right hand side of the square on the short side. Opposite these are two triangles, identical to the one on the short side. One player plays as six deer, which begin on the points where the small squares intersect with the main board. The other player plays with a number of dogs ( between 12 and 80), at least some of which begin in the main part of the board, but some may be introduced later. Pieces move to an adjacent empty spot along the lines of the board. The deer may capture an adjacent dog by hopping over it to an empty space immediately on the opposite side of it along the lines of the board. the goal of the deer is to capture all of the dogs, the goal of the dogs is to block the deer from being able to move.
