Three diamonds are also drawn within the squares, connecting the midpoints of a square to the corners of the next smallest square. Players alternate turns placing one of their pieces on an empty spot on the board. When all of the pieces are placed, they alternate turns moving one of their pieces to an empty adjacent spot along the lines of the board. During either phase, when a player places three of their pieces in a row along a line that has only three spots, or four in a row along a line that has four spots, they may remove one of the opponent's pieces from the board. Pieces which are in a three- or four-in-a-row arrangement cannot be removed from the board. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.
