        (description "12-Ring is a prehistoric game from Bronze Age Crete. The repeated occurrence of the pattern of twelve depressions in a circle found as graffiti at sites on Crete led to the speculation that it might be a game. Spatial analysis also showed that these boards were found in locations typically chosen by game players.")
