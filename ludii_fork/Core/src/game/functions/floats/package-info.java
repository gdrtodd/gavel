/**
 * @chapter Float functions are ludemes that return a single floating point value produced by a specified function. 
 * They specify the {\it amount} of certain aspects of the game state, in a continuous rather than discrete space.
 * Float parameters are always shown with their decimal point, e.g. 12.0, to clearly distinguish them from integer values.
