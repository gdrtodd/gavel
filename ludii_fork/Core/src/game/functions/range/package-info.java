/**
 * @chapter Range functions are ludemes that define a range of integer values with a lower and upper bound (inclusive). 
 * Ranges are useful for restricting integer values to sensible limits, e.g. for capping maximum bets 
 * in betting games or for situations in which negative values should be avoided.
 * 
 * @section The base {\tt range} function defines a range with upper and lower board (inclusive), 
 * optionally according to some specified condition.
