/**
 * The {\tt heuristics} package includes information about which heuristics are relevant to the current game, 
 * and their optimal settings and weights. 
 * Heuristics are simple rules of thumb for estimating the positional strength of players in a given game state. 
 * Each heuristic focusses on a particular aspect of the game, e.g. material piece count, piece mobility, etc.
