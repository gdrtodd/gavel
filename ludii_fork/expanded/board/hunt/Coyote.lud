One player plays with one piece "presumably the coyote," the other with the other twelve pieces, placed on intersections of the lines. Pieces move to an adjacent intersection connected to the present position by a line. The "coyote" may take the opponent's pieces by hopping over them. Multiple captures are allowed if possible, Captures are obligatory. The goal of the coyote is to capture all of the opponent's pieces; the other player's goal is to block the coyote so it cannot move. The coyote can jump to capture.
