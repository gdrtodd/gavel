The game is played on a cruciform board adapted from an Alquerque board. One player plays as the fox, the other as the geese. The geese begin in a set starting position; the person playing as the fox may choose any available spot to place the fox as their first move. Players move as in Alquerque, but only the fox can hop to capture. The goal of the geese is to block the fox from being able to move; the fox's goal is to capture all of the geese. The game starts with 13 geese.
