A triangle, with a line drawn from the apex to the base, and two lines drawn through the height connecting the opposite two sides. One player plays as one tiger, the other as five lambs. The tiger begins on the apex of the triangle. The tiger moves to an empty adjacent spot along the lines of the board. The player who plays as the lambs plays first, placing a lamb on an empty spot on the board, and then the tiger player moves. When all of the lambs are placed, the lambs move in the same manner as the tiger. The tiger may capture a lamb by hopping over it to an empty space on the opposite adjacent side of the lamb along the lines on the board. The lambs win when they block the tiger from being able to move, the tiger wins by capturing enough lambs so that it cannot be blocked.
