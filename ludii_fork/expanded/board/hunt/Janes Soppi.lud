3x3 intersecting lines, with triangles extending on opposite ends of the large square and the central line extending to the apices. One player plays as the notched stick, called the hare, and the other as three sharp sticks, known as the hounds. Players alternate turns placing a piece on the board. When a player has placed all of their pieces on the board, they move one of their pieces to an empty adjacent spot along the lines. When the hounds block the hare from being able to move, the hounds win. The game has an ending condition only for P1.
