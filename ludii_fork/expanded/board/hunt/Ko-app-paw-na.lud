One player has a single piece, the other has twelve, playing as jackrabbits. The player playing as the jackrabbits attempts to move all of their pieces to the opposite side of the board until they form the same configuration as the starting position on the opposite side. Pieces move orthogonally to accomplish this. The opponent's goal is to capture one of the jackrabbits by hopping over it.
