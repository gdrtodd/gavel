The game is played either by two teams of two players, or by two players playing with two sets of pieces. The pieces move along the outer track of the board according to dice throws. If a piece lands on a space occupied by an opponent, the opponent's piece is sent back to the starting position. Certain marked squares indicate spaces where pieces are safe from being sent back. After completing a circuit of the board, the pieces then move into the central row of squares in the arm where the player began. The player must then move off all of their pieces by an exact roll. The player or team to remove all of their pieces from the board first wins.
