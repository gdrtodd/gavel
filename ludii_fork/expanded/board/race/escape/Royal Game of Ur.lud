Each player starts play on one of the top corners of the 3x4 grid, proceeding down that row to the opposite corner, and then up the central track, which both players use, and then turning back toward the original side of the track when reaching the top of the central track in the 2x3 grid. If a player lands on an opponent's spot, they are removed from the board and may reenter on a subsequent turn. A rosette in the center of the central track marks the spot where a player is safe from capture. Rosettes in the four corners allow a player to roll again. A player wins when they remove all seven of their pieces from the board by rolling the exact number of spaces left in the track, plus one. The pieces follow the track described by Finkel. The rosettes are protecting the pieces and allow them to replay.
