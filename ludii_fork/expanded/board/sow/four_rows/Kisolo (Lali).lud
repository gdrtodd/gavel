4x8 board. Four counters in each of the holes in each player's inner row. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction, with the first counter being sown into the hole from which the counters were picked up. When the final counter lands in an empty hole, the player's turn ends. When the final counter lands in an occupied hole in the inner row, the player captures the counters in the opponent's opposite inner row hole, and continues sowing with these counters and the counters in the hole where the final counter was dropped.. When the final counter lands in an occupied hole but a capture is not possible, these counters are picked up and sowing continues. Play continues until one player can no longer play, and the opponent wins.
