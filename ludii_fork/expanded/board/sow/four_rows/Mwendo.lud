4x4-16 board, played only along the perimeter. Three counters per hole. Any number of players. Holes are distributed equally among the players. Sowing occurs in a clockwise direction. Counters are sown one per occupied hole, two per empty hole. Each player owns the holes in which their counters are located at the beginning of their turn, and they must sow from the rightmost hole. If the final counter of a sowing falls into an empty hole, the player sows again from the rightmost hole. Alternatively, a player may place all of the counters from the rightmost counter into the next hole, but this cannot be done after a move. When counters fall into holes belonging to an opponent, these hole and the counters in it are captured by the player, but remain in play. When a player has a single counter and empty holes in from of it, this counter leaps to the next hole occupied by the opponent. The player who captures all of the opponent's holes wins. Each row has 10 holes.
