4x8 board, played only along the perimeter. One to four counters per hole. Any number of players, holes are distributed equally among the players. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. Each player owns the holes in which their counters are located at the beginning of their turn, and they must sow from the leftmost hole. When a counter falls into a hole containing counters belonging to the opponent, this hole and the counters in it are captured by the player, but remain in place and in play. When a player has a single counter and empty holes in from of it, this counter leaps to the next hole occupied by the opponent. The player who captures all of the opponent's holes wins. 4 seeds per hole. The board is a 4x8.
