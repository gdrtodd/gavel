Two rows of five holes arranged in a circle around four stores in the center. Each player has five holes on one half of the circle. Ten counters in each hole. Players sow from their holes, and can choose to sow any number of counters, but must leave at least one in the starting hole. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. If sowing ends in a hole making its contents an odd number of counters, they are captured, but not more than nine. If the sowing ends and the last counter makes the contents of a hole an even number and the next hole has an odd number of counters, the contents of the odd hole are taken, but not more than nine. In both situations, if there is an unbroken sequence of holes with an odd number of counters, these are all taken, but not more than nine from each.
