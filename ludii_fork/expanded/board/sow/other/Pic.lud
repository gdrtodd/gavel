Played by two to five players. Each player has three heaps of counters, with twelve counters per heap. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. When a player creates a heap containing three counters in an opponent's heap, a circle is drawn around the heap and the player captures the counters in it and every counter sown into it for the rest of the game. When there are no heaps left, the player with the most counters wins. Each hole contains initially 12 seeds. The game is played with 5 players.
