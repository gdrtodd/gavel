Seven holes, arranged in a circle. Four counters in each hole. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. When the final counter lands in a hole, the contents of the next hole are picked up and sowing continues with those counters. When the hole from which this new sowing would occur is empty, the counters in the next hole are captured and the turn ends. The next player begins to sow from the next available hole with counters after the last one played by the opponent. Play continues until no further captures can be made, and the player with the most counters wins.
