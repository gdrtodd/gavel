2x7 board, with two stores. Seven counters in each hole. Players sow from any hole on their side of the board, in a clockwise direction, and sow into the store on their left, but not the one on the right. When the final counter of a sowing lands in an occupied hole that is not the store, the player picks up these counters and continues sowing. When then final counter lands in an empty hole, the turn ends. When the final counter lands in the store, the turn ends. Play continues until all of the counters are in the stores, and the player with the most counters in their store wins.
