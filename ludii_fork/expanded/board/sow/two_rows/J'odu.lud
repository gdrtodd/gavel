2x6 board, which two stores. Four counters in each hole. Sowing proceeds in an anti-clockwise direction. When the final counter of a sowing falls in to an occupied hole, these counters are picked up and sowing continues. When the final hole lands in an empty hole, if the hole is in the player's row, the contents of the opponent's opposite hole are captured. If the empty hole is in the opponent's row, the turn ends. A player must play so that the opponent is able to play on their next turn, if possible. The player who captures the most counters wins.
