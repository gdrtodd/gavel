Play begins with seven counters in each hole. Players begin by picking up the counters in one of their holes and sowing them anti-clockwise. If the final counter lands in an opponent's hole or the rightmost hole belonging to the player sowing, having dropped counters in the opponent's holes making them contain two, four, or six counters, the contents of those holes are captured. The player who has the most counters at the end of the game wins.
