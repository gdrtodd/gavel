2x6 board with two stores. Play begins with four counters in each hole. A move begins from any of a player's holes, sowing happens anti-clockwise. Move ends if the last counter falls into an empty hole. If it lands in a hole with counters, these are picked up and sowing continues, unless the sowing makes the last hole contain four counters, in which case these are captured and the sowing continues from the next hole. When both players have too few counters to play, each one makes one move with one of their counters and then adds all of the counters on their side of the board to the store. The player with the most counters in the store wins.
