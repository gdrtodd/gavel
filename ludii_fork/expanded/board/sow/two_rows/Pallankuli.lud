2x7 board. Six counters in each hole. Play begins from any one of a player's holes, even if there is just one. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. If they end in a hole with counters, these are picked up and sowing continues. If sowing ends in an empty hole, the contents of the next hole are captured and the turn ends. When sowing, if the contents of a hole are brought to four, they are immediately captured by the player in whose row the counters are located. Play ends when a player has no counters in their holes, remaining player takes all the remaining counters. In the next round, the player with the smaller number of counters captured from the previous round fills as many of their holes as they can, starting from the left and filling each hole with six counters. Leftover counters are placed in the player's store. The opponent then does the same. Any holes remaining empty are out of play for this round, otherwise play continues as before. The right to begin alternates from round to round. Further rounds are played until one player has fewer than six counters.
