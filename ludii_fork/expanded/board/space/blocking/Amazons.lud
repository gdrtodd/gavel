Played on a 10x10 board. Each player has four Amazons (chess queens), with other pieces used as arrows. Two things happen on a turn: an amazon moves like a Chess queen, but cannot cross or enter a space occupied by another amazon or arrow. Then, it shoots an arrow to any space on the board that is along the path of a queen's move from that place. The last player able to make a move wins.
(game "Amazons" (players 2) (equipment {(board (square 10)) (piece "Queen" Each (move Slide (then (moveAgain)))) (piece "Dot" Neutral)}) (rules (start {(place "Queen1" {"A4" "D1" "G1" "J4"}) (place "Queen2" {"A7" "D10" "G10" "J7"})}) (play (if (is Even (count Moves)) (forEach Piece) (move Shoot (piece "Dot0")))) (end (if (no Moves Next) (result Mover Win)))))
