Players take turns placing one of their stones on an empty square. It is not legal to place orthogonally adjacent to only enemy stones and it is not legal to place orthogonally adjacent to more than 1 friendly stone. All other placements onto empty squares are legal. Put differently: You may place adjacent to no stone or to exactly 1 friendly and any number of enemy stones. The first player unable to place a stone has won the game. A 6x6 board is currently selected
(game "Pathway" (players 2) (equipment {(board (square 6)) (piece "Disc" Each)}) (rules (play (move Add (to (sites Empty) if:(or (all Sites (sites Around (to) Orthogonal) if:(is Empty (site))) (equals 1 (count Sites in:(sites Around (to) Own Orthogonal))))))) (end (if (no Moves Next) (result Next Win)))))
