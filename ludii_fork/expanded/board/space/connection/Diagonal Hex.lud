Players take turns placing their pieces on one space on the board, with the goal of connecting the opposite sides of the board corresponding to the color of their pieces with a line of pieces. The game is played on a 11x11 board. The board is a diamond tiling by hexagon. The game uses the swap rule. The first player to connect their two sides wins. The connection between two stones is using all the diagonal directions.
