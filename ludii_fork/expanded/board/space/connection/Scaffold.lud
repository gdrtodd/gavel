Definitions Group: Either a single stone (a group of one) or any number of stones of the same color connected through a continuous series of orthogonal adjacencies. Rules Scaffold is a drawless connection game played on the intersections of a square grid using stones (as in Go). Black is trying to connect N-S edges of the board, White E-W with an orthogonally connected group. First player places a single black stone on any grid intersection, after which the second player decides which color they will play (pie rule). Players then alternate taking turns. On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty point. Then, if possible, place a stone of your color on an empty point that is orthogonally adjacent to two groups of your color, and keep making such placements until no more are possible. A 12x12 board is currently selected
