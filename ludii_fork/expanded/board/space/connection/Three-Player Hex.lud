As in standard Hex, players take turn placing a piece of their color on an empty cell, and the first player to connect the opposite sides of the board marked his color with a chain of his pieces wins. As soon as it it no longer possible for a player to connect his edges, that player is eliminated from the game and may not place any more stones. The game is played on a 4x4 board The first player to connect his two sides wins.
