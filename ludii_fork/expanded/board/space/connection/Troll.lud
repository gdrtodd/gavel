EDGES - Each player owns two opposite edges, say, the first player has top and bottom edges, while the second player has left and right edges. DROP - Each player drops one of his stones on an empty cell. - If at least one opponent stone is between that stone and another friendly stone (orthogonal or diagonal), then all opponent stones that were between those stones flip their colour. - Stones cannot be dropped on the opponent's edges (including corners). GOAL - Wins the first player who manages to do a path connecting his two opposite edges. - Two tiles diagonally aside are not continuous in a path. - The corners belong to both edges.
