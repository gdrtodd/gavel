Players take turns placing a stone of their own color on any empty cell of a hexagonal grid of hexagons (a hexhex board). The game is over when the board is full, and the player with the lower score wins. Your score is 1 point per odd-sized group and 2 points even-sized group. In this implementation, you get -1 per odd-sized group and -2 per even-sized group, so the winner will be the player with the higher score. The score is currently updated after each move, and groups of even size are marked with a red outline. A size 5 board is currently selected
