Each turn you must perform exactly one of the following two actions: 1. Add a friendly piece orthogonally adjacent to one of your pieces. 2. Remove an enemy group. As soon as one player only has 1 group, the game is over and that player is the winner. A size 10 board is currently selected
(game "Gygoreg" (players 2) (equipment {(board (square Diamond 10)) (piece "Disc" Each)}) (rules (start {(place "Disc1" (forEach (sites Phase 0) if:(is Odd (site)))) (place "Disc2" (forEach (sites Phase 0) if:(is Even (site))))}) (play (or (move Add (to (sites Around (sites Occupied by:Mover) Empty Orthogonal))) (move Select (from (sites Occupied by:Enemy)) (then (forEach Site (sites Group at:(last From) Orthogonal) (remove (site))))))) (end {(if (equals 1 (count Groups Orthogonal if:(equals (who at:(to)) P1))) (result P1 Win)) (if (equals 1 (count Groups Orthogonal if:(equals (who at:(to)) P2))) (result P2 Win))})))
