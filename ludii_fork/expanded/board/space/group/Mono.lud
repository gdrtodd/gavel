Players take turns placing a stone of their own color on any empty cell of a hexagonal grid of hexagons (a hexhex board). The game is over when the board is full, and the player with the lower score wins. If both players have the same number of groups, your score is your number of odd-sized groups, otherwise it is simply your number of groups. The running score only shows the number of odd groups (with a minus sign in front of it, for technical reasons). Groups of odd size is marked with a red outline. A size 5 board is currently selected
