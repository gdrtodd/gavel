Play: Players take turns placing one stone of their color on any empty hex. Goal: When the board is full, the game is over and the player with the higher score is the winner. Scoring: Each stone is worth 1 point for its owner if it is part of a group connecting opposite sides of the board, and -1 point otherwise. The scoring trick that gave the game its name – namely that each stone is worth either +1 point or -1 point – was (unbeknownst to the inventor of Signum) discovered by Brian Wittmann (the inventor of Loops) 9 years earlier. The score is currently updated only when the board is full. (This makes the AI stronger.) A size 6 board is currently selected
(game "Signum" (players 2) (equipment {(board (hex 6)) (piece "Disc" Each)}) (rules (meta (swap)) (play (move Add (to (sites Empty)))) (end (if (is Full) (byScore {(score P1 (add (results from:(sites Occupied by:P1) to:0 (if (or {(is Connected at:(from) {(sites Side N) (sites Side S)}) (is Connected at:(from) {(sites Side NW) (sites Side SE)}) (is Connected at:(from) {(sites Side NE) (sites Side SW)})}) 1 -1)))) (score P2 (add (results from:(sites Occupied by:P2) to:0 (if (or {(is Connected at:(from) {(sites Side N) (sites Side S)}) (is Connected at:(from) {(sites Side NW) (sites Side SE)}) (is Connected at:(from) {(sites Side NE) (sites Side SW)})}) 1 -1))))})))))
