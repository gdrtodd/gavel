Two concentric squares with a line connecting their midpoints. Six pieces per player. Players alternate placing one of their pieces on the intersections of the lines. Whenever a player places three of their pieces in a row, they may remove one of the opponent's pieces from the board. Once all of the pieces are placed, players may take turns moving a piece to an adjacent point along the lines, attempting to place three of their pieces in a row. When one player is reduced to two pieces, that player loses. The game is played according to the rules of Murray.
