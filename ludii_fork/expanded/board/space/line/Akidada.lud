3x3 intersecting lines. Three sticks per player, the sticks angled toward the player to indicate ownership. Players alternate turns placing sticks on the board. Once all of the sticks are placed, players alternate turns moving a stick to any empty spot on the board. The first player to place three sticks in an orthogonal row along the lines wins.
