Players take turns placing their pieces on one empty space on the board, with the goal of making a line with stones connected diagonally of at least length 4. The length of the line is 4 or more. The game is played on a 11x11 board. The board is a diamond tiling by hexagon. The game uses the swap rule. The first player to connect their two sides wins. The connection between two stones is using all the diagonal directions.
