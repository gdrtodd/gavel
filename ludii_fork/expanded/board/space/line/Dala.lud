6x6 board. Each player has twelve sticks. One player's sticks are without bark to distinguish them. Players placing their sticks in empty spaces, filling the central four first. Once all of the sticks have been placed, the players may move their sticks orthogonally one space. If a player can bring three of their sticks in a row, they may then remove one of the opponent's sticks during either phase of the game. During the movement phase, if a player has a row of four pieces and moves one away, leaving a row of three spaces, this also allows the player to capture an opponent's piece. The player who can no longer play loses.
