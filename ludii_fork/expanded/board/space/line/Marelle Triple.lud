Three concentric squares, the corners and midpoints of the squares connected with lines. Nine pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing a piece on an empty spot on the board. When all of the pieces are placed, the players alternate turns moving a piece to an empty adjacent spot along the lines. During either phase, when a player places three of their pieces in a row along the orthogonal lines (not along the diagonal lines), the player removes any one of the opponent's pieces. When a player is reduced to four pieces, they may move a piece to any open spot on the board. The player who reduces the opponent to two pieces wins.
