DROP - On each turn, each player picks any stone of either color, and changes its color. Then, like in Othello, flips all stones of the other color that are between that stone and the next of same color, in any orthogonal or diagonal direction. GOAL - One player wins if it is able to make an horizontal 8 in-a-row of stones of any color. The other player wins by making a vertical 8 in-a-row. If, after a move, there are one horizontal and one vertical 8 in-a-row, the player that made the move losses.
