Three concentric squares, with lines connecting the midpoints and diagonals of the squares. Twelve pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing one of their pieces on the board. When all of the pieces are placed, the pieces may be moved to an empty adjacent spot on the board. One player wins by placing three of their pieces in a row. The other player wins by blocking their opponent from being able to move. Player 1 wins by blocking.
