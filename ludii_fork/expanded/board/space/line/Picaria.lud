Played on a 3x3 board. Three pieces per player. Players take turns placing the pieces on the board. Once all the pieces are placed, players take turns moving a piece to an adjacent spot. The points where the diagonals of the squares cross are not eligible spots. The first player to align all three of their pieces in a row wins. The board has 9 holes. The pieces can be placed to any empty site.
