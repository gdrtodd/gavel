Starting with white, each player places a marble on an empty space or platform (2x2 arrangement of marbles). A player wins by making a line of L pieces of their colour orthogonally or diagonally (where L is the layer size) but loses by making a line of L-1 of their colour beforehand (without also making a line of L). Two players. 4x4 square pyramidal board.
(game "Spava" (players 2) (equipment {(board (square 4 pyramidal:True) use:Vertex) (piece "Ball" Each)}) (rules (play (move Add (to (sites Empty) if:(is Flat)))) (end {(if (is Line (sub (count Rows) (layer of:(last To))) SameLayer) (result Mover Win)) (if (is Line (sub (sub (count Rows) (layer of:(last To))) 1) SameLayer) (result Mover Loss))})))
