5x6 board. Each player has twelve pieces. Players alternate placing their pieces until they are all placed on the board. The goal is to make a line of three, which allows the player to capture one of the opponent's pieces. Once the pieces are all on the board, they may be moved one space orthogonally. In the case that a move creates two lines of three, only one capture is made. The player who makes the last possible capture wins.
