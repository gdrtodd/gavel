3x3 intersecting lines, with diagonals. Three pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing one of their pieces on the board. Once all of the pieces are placed, players take turns moving one of their pieces to an adjacent empty spot. The first player to make an orthogonal line with their pieces wins.
