Players take turns placing stones of their color on empty squares. If you place orthogonally adjacent to more than 2 stones, regardless of their color, you must place again. You continue until you place orthogonally adjacent to 2 or fewer stones. When the board is full, the player with the most stones on the board is the winner. A 7x7 playing area is currently selected
