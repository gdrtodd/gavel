Players place one token of their color each turn and the first player unable to do so has lost. You may place on any empty cell unless your opponent has a token closer to that cell than you have along at least 2 of the 3 lines (axes) the cell is on. The game uses the pie rule: One player chooses the first move and the other player chooses whose move it is. A size 5 board is currently selected
