This is basically 4-player Othello, albeit more "friendly", since you can place a piece of your color even if you have none on the board. It features unique ball-shaped objects that have four colors. You "roll" them to the proper color when converting them, as opposed to flipping in 2-player Othello. The game adds a higher chaos factor in the 3 and 4 player game since you don't have any control over what your opponents do. The game is playing with four players.
