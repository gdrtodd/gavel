Each player has four pieces. Players take turns moving a piece to an empty dot. A player may capture an opponent’s piece by placing a piece on either side of an opponent’s piece. If a player moves their own piece between two of the opponent’s pieces, it is not captured. A player wins by reducing the opponent to one piece. The game is played according to the rules of the source.
