3x3 intersecting lines, with diagonals in the four squares formed. Six pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing one of their pieces on the board. when all of the pieces have been placed, players alternate turns moving a piece by jumping over an adjacent spot to the next spot, along the lines of the board, which must be empty. If an opponent's piece is in the spot which was jumped, that piece is captured. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.
