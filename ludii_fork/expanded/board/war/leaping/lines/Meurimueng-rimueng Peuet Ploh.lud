9x9 intersecting lines, with diagonals drawn in every 4x4 square formed. Forty pieces per player, placed on the board with the central space unoccupied. Players alternate turns moving one piece to an empty adjacent spot. They may capture an opponent's piece by hopping over it. Multiple hops in one turn are allowed, but not required. The first person to capture all of the opponent's pieces wins.
