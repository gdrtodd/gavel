Each player begins with nine pieces. Pieces moves along the lines to the next intersection point. Players may hop an opponent's piece to capture it. Captures can be made in sequence if another capture is available after the previous one is made. The player who captures all of their opponent's pieces wins. The player loses when he has no piece.
