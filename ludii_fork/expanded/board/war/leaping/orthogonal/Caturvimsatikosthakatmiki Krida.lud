3x8 board. The second space from the left and from the right in the center row are marked with an X. Eight pieces per player, which begin in the row closest to the player. Players alternate turns moving a piece to an empty adjacent space in an orthogonal direction. On the first move of a piece, that piece may move two spaces in one direction. A player may capture an opponent's piece in the central row by hopping over it to an empty space on the opposite side of it. The player who reduces their opponent to fewer than four pieces wins.
