TURNS - At each turn, each player must move one of his stones (called Kangaroos): - A stone must jump over one (orthogonal or diagonal) adjacent stone landing on the immediate next empty cell. - If the jumped enemy stones are captured and removed from the board. - Jumps can be multiple but are not mandatory. GOAL - The game ends when one player cannot move. The winner is the one with more stones.
