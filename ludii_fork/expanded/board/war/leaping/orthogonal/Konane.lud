10x10 board. The black player starts by removing one black piece either from one of the central four spaces of the board or from one of the four corners. The white player then must remove a white piece that is orthogonally adjacent to the empty space. Play proceeds by orthogonally jumping an opposing piece and capturing it. All moves must be capturing moves. Multiple captures can be made only by continuing in the same direction. The first player unable to move loses. The game is played on a 10x10 board.
