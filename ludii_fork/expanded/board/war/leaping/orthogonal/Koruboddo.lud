5x5 board. Twelve pieces per player, arranged in the two rows in front of each player, and in the right two squares in the central row (the central space is empty). Players alternate turns moving a piece to an adjacent orthogonal space. The player may capture an opponent's piece by hopping over it in an orthogonal direction. Multiple hops are allowed in the same turn, but captures are not compulsory, The player who captures all of their opponent's pieces wins.
