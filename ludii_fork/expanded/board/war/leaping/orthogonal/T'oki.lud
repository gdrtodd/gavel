5x5 board. Twenty pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing pieces on the board, two at a time into the same square. At any time, a player may move one piece from a square one spot in an orthogonal direction. Pieces may capture opponent's pieces when either a single square or an unbroken line of squares with opponent's pieces has an empty space beyond it; the player's piece hops over the opponent's pieces and captures them all. When the unbroken line ends at the edge of the board, it is treated as though there were an empty square beyond the edge of the board, and the capturing piece is placed on the last space on the board in that line. Players may enter any reserved pieces on any turn as they see fit. The player to capture all of the opponent's pieces wins.
