5x5 board. Twelve pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing a piece on the board, leaving the central space empty. Once all of the pieces have been placed, players alternate turns moving a piece to an empty adjacent space in an orthogonal or diagonal direction. A player may capture an opponent's piece adjacent to one of their own by hopping over it to an empty space immediately on the opposite side of the opponent's piece. Multiple captures are allowed. The player who captures all of their opponent's pieces wins.
