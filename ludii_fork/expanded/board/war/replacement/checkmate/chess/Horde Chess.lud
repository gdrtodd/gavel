The rules are the same as for Chess with these differences: White wins by capturing all black pieces. Black wins by checkmating the white king. If no black piece can make a valid move, the game is a draw (stalemate). Black pawns can be promoted to a black queen, rook, bishop or knight if they reach the last row. Black pawns cannot move two spaces forward from any position except the second rank.
