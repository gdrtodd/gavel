McCooey Chess is played on a hexagonal board with each side having length 6, and each space oriented horizontally. The board has has 91 spaces. Piece Movement: * All pieces other than Pawns move as in Glinski Chess. - Kings step one space in any of the 12 directions. They do not castle. - Queens slide in any of the 12 directions. - Rooks slide in any of the 6 adjacent direction. - Bishops slide in any of the 6 'diagonal' directions. - Knights move two spaces in any adjacent direction, then one space in another direction. * Pawns can advance one space forward without capturing. A Pawn on a Pawn start space but not in the innermost column can advance two spaces forward without capturing. Pawns capture 'diagonally forward' (i.e., to a space ahead connected by an edge, and having the same colour). En Passant capture and Pawn promotion take place as in Glinski Chess. The game ends on a checkmate or stalemate.
