The following rules are additionally used to the chess rules: - Pawns can only advance one space on their first move. There is no en passant capturing. - A pawn can only promote to a captured piece. - There is no castling. - If 20 moves are played without a capture or promotion, the player with the most `points' on the board wins. (Pawn=1 pt., Bishop/Knight=3, Rook=5, Queen = 9.) The game starts like in the encyclopedia of Chess Variants.
