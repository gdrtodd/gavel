Ultimate Chess is a variant of Chess played on a 9x9 Sudoku checkerboard as shown, with same rules as Chess except: - Pawns can move 2 or 3 steps forward in their first move. The pawn can be captured by En Passant if they do a such move. - Kings can make a large casting in either side. - The next player must move from the sub-grid corresponding to the cell just moved to (if they have a legal move from there).
