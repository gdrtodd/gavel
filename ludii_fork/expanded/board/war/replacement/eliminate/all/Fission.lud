TURN - On each turn, each player slides (orthogonally or diagonally) a stone until it hits another stone or a wall. If it stops because of a stone, the moving stone and all adjacent stones (of either color) are removed. GOAL - The player with no stones onboard loses. The game is a draw if (i) the board becomes empty, or (ii) each player has just one stone, or (iii) the moving player has no valid moves.
