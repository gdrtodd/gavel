On your turn you have to options: • Noncapturing move: Step kingwise away from the center of the line you are stepping along. • Capturing move: Capture queenwise any enemy not farther away from the center of the line you are moving along. Only if you have no moves may you pass. The game is over when only one player has pieces left. That player is the winner. A 6x6 board is currently selected
