Goal: Connect your opposite sides with a continuous chain of stones on edge-to-edge ('orthogonally adjacent') cells. Achieving the goal ends the game. Players take turns. There is no passing. -- On a turn the mover either places a stone from their supply on an empty space, or uses it to replace an opponent's stone on a space that the mover controls. Edge spaces are controlled by two orthogonally adjacent mover stones that are also orthogonally adjacent to each other. All other spaces are controlled by having at least 3 orthogonally adjacent mover stones, one of which that is both orthogonally adjacent to the second, and diagonally adjacent to the third. Using an order 1 board with 48 cells A mutually adjacent pair of your pieces to an edge location gives control there. To control a site with your adjacent stones, one stone must connect to a second orthogonally, and to a third diagonally.
