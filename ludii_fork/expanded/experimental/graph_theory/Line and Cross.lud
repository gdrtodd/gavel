Initially, there is a number of edges in a plane, where some of them cross each other. At each turn, a player selects an edge to remove it and all of its intersecting edges. The number of edges with which a selected edge intersects is added to the player's score. When there are no moves left, the game is over. Finally, the player with the highest score wins.  The version of the game played with 2 players.
