Starting of the game, the player can select the goal of the puzzle, which can be spanning tree or caterpillar tree. This game has two versions: addition and deletion version. At the addition version, the board graph is initially uncoloured. Players take turns to colour an uncoloured edge by a common colour. After colouring some edges, if the player makes a spanning tree (or caterpillar tree), he wins. At the other version, the game starts with all the same coloured edges. At each turn, a player chooses to remove the colour of a coloured edge. After removing some coloured edges, if the player makes his desired tree (spanning or caterpillar tree), he wins. The game is played on the Graph1. The players play on Addition version.
