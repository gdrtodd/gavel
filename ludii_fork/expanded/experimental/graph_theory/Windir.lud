This game has two versions: an addition and a deletion version. In the addition version, the graph is initially uncoloured. Players alternate turns, colouring an uncoloured edge in a common colour. However, in the deletion version, the game starts with all the edges coloured. At each turn, a player chooses to remove the colour of an edge. In both versions, the current player loses by turning the coloured graph into a regular graph. The game is played on the Graph2. The players play on Addition version.
