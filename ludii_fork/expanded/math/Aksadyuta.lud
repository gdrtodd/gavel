There is a large number of aká¹£as (beans) in a container, divisible by five. One player grasps a random number of them, and throws them onto a mat. The beans grabbed by the player is a "grasp," and the kind of grasp determines the winner. The type of grasp is determined by the number of beans grabbed by the player. The grasps are: Krta: a multiple of four (e.g., 12); Kali: a multiple of four plus one (e.g., 13); Dvapara: A multiple of four plus two (e.g., 14); Treta: a multiple of four plus 3 (e.g., 15). Krta beats all others, Kali always loses, Treta beats Dvapara. The game is played with the rules of Syed.
