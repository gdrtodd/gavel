The goal of Theseus is to escape of the labyrinth. Theseus can step orthogonally but after steping the Minotaur comes closer to him twice faster. If the minotaur catches him, Theseus dies. The board in Wikipedia. The minotaur comes closer to Theseus in looking only the number of orthogonal steps without to take in account the walls. Theseus wins immediately if he reaches the exit.
