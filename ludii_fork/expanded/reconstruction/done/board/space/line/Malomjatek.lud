The game Malomjatek is played by two players on a square board with concentric tiling. All players play with Markers. Rules for Pieces: Markers step orthogonal then for all flanked pieces on Vertexes starting from the to location of the last move with Orthogonal direction with a limit of 1 pieces if the target is there is an enemy Player at between if the friend is is a friendremove pieces at between and for all surrounded pieces on Vertexes starting from the to location of the last move with Orthogonal direction if the target is there is an enemy Player at between and between is in the corner sites of the board if the friend is is a friend except if 0remove pieces at between. Players take turns moving. Rules: If in the same turn, remove pieces at sites occupied by any component owned by Enemy in Board, else from vertex in Player the moving player's hand site 0 to vertex in the set of empty vertexs moveRule: true then if a player places 3 of their pieces in an orthogonal direction line, move again if in the same turn, remove pieces at sites occupied by any component owned by Enemy in Board, else move one of your pieces. Aim: If the number of pieces owned by Player the next player is less than or equal to 2, the next player loses. The Malomjatek (Ludii 1) ruleset.
