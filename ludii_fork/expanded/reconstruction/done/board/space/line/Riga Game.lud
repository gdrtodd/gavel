The game Riga Game is played by two players on a noshape board with nobasis tiling. All players play with Markers. Rules for Pieces: Markers step adjacent then if a player places 3 of their pieces in an orthogonal direction line, move again. Players take turns moving. Rules: If in the same turn, if can move remove pieces at not a player places 3 of their pieces in an orthogonal direction line sites occupied by any component owned by Enemy in Board, remove pieces at not a player places 3 of their pieces in an orthogonal direction line sites occupied by any component owned by Enemy in Board, else remove pieces at sites occupied by any component owned by Enemy in Board, else from vertex in Player the moving player's hand site 0 to vertex in the set of empty vertexs moveRule: true then if a player places 3 of their pieces in an orthogonal direction line, move again if in the same turn, if can move remove pieces at not a player places 3 of their pieces in an orthogonal direction line sites occupied by any component owned by Enemy in Board, remove pieces at not a player places 3 of their pieces in an orthogonal direction line sites occupied by any component owned by Enemy in Board, else remove pieces at sites occupied by any component owned by Enemy in Board, else if the number of pieces owned by Player the moving player is greater than 3, move one of your pieces, else from vertex in sites occupied by any component owned by Mover to vertex in the set of empty vertexs moveRule: true. Aim: If the number of pieces owned by Player the next player is less than or equal to 2, the next player loses. The Riga Game (Ludii 1) ruleset.
